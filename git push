Go to the place you want store the file:
    $ cd desktop

Download the file from remote repository and make some changes locally:
    $ git clone https://github.com/SueTan00/Git.git
    $ cd Git
    $ touch "git push"
    $ echo "test" >> git push
    $ git add *
    $ git commit -m "push test"

Push the change from local to remote:
    $ git push https://github.com/SueTan00/Git.git
    
If fail, might be changes occurred at remote as well, so pull first under the clone file:
    $ git pull
